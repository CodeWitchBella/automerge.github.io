# Before we start

We will build a small web app during this tutorial. This tutorial is designed to walk you through the basic concepts of Automerge so that you can use it in your own apps. For a deeper understanding and common patterns that you would likely need in a production application, see the [Cookbook](docs/cookbook/modeling-data). You will find that these two resources are complementary.
 
## What you need to know

To complete this tutorial, we assume you have a working knowledge of HTML and JavaScript. If you're coming from another programming language, we've designed it to be simple enough that you should also be able to follow along.

## What are we building?
