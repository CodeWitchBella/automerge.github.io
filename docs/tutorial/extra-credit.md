You did it! Now, you should have a general understanding about how to create an interactive, multi-user app that saves data to the local machine using Automerge. 

To see the full working code, look on GitHub: [https://github.com/okdistribute/automerge-tutorial](https://github.com/okdistribute/automerge-tutorial)

## Conflicts

0. Add a delete button for each todo.
1. Rename `index.html` to `todo.html`
2. Add a new `index.html`, which consists of two iframes pointing at `todo.html`. 
3. Add a button that turns off BroadcastChannel between these two iframes.

Disconnect the broadcast channel.

Add todos on one side, and modify or delete them on the other side. What happened?

## All done?

Modify this [tutorial on GitHub](https://github.com/automerge/automerge.github.io) to improve it!
