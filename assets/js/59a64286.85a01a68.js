In contrast, an app backed with MongoDB stores the data primarily on a Cloud server. To change a document, you can send an HTTP PUT or POST request to the server. If you're offline, you can't make changes to the database. If you cache a user's requests and send them once you come online, users could accidentally override each other's work. This means that Cloud application require users to be online in order to change or interact with data. The server handles things like race conditions and transactions to ensure that everyone sees the same application state and (hopefully) no one's work gets lost. In contrast, the apps you can build with automerge don't require a server. Instead, every device is a copy of the entire database (or a queried subset or snapshot).
